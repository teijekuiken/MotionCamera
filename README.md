# Movement camera
For a school assignment we had to demonstrate that we understood and could implement stateful concepts and could wrap our head around Arduino's.
To prove that I'm sufficient with this subjects I created a motionsensor that takes a picture in another part of the room then when where the motion is detected.

The motion sensor has a range for up to 7 meters but just as everbody you will have a living room that is far longer then 7 meters ;) so that's why the different modules.

## What do you need?
For this project you will need the following components:

- Raspberry Pi model 3 or 4 with WiFi.
- Arduino Nano IoT 33
- Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera V2 or Camera Module V2
- PIR Motion sensor
- Solder
- Soldering iron
- 3 Male to Female cables
- 2 jumper cables
- BreadBoard
