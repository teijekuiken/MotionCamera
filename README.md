# Movement camera
For a school assignment we had to demonstrate that we understood and could implement stateful concepts and could wrap our head around Arduino's.
To prove that I'm sufficient with this subjects I created a motionsensor that takes a picture in another part of the room then when where motion is detected.

## What do you need?
